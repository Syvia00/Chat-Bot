General On-site kits & Asiga Academy
 Please note, Asiga sent a reseller announcement email beginning of 2022, stating that the MAX and/or PRO4K toolkits are mandatory for all resellers, as well as an external radiometer. So you will need to have these on-site kits in order to troubleshoot and maintain the printers. The on-site kits can be found in the Asiga online store: https://myaccount.asiga.com/store/?c=46&q=&o=category#100

The MAX Reseller Service Toolkit is PN/05359 with a dealer price of $495USD.

The PRO 4K Reseller Service Toolkit is PN/05226 with a dealer price of $89USD.

Please let us know if you would like to place an order, as these tools will enable you to be able to service the printers better.

There is also the Asiga academy for resellers, to provide training for servicing the printers.
