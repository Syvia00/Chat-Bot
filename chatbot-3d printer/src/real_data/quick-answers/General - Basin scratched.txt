General Basin scratched
 If the glass is only lightly scratched, the print results may not be adversely affected. Please check by printing, if the damage to the glass is affecting the printed results. For example having extra cured material on the models or the actual scratches are visible on the model. If it is, it would be necessary to change the basin.

A replacement basin for the max is PN/02476 and is dealer price $395USD, and RRP $580USD.

Please let us know if you would like to place an order.

If there is resin on the glass, it will be able to be removed.
This means there may be no need to replace anything, just that the glass needs cleaning.

Soak a paper towel in IPA (IsoPropyl Alcohol), and lay it over where the resin is on the glass. this will stop the resin from evaporating so quickly, and keep the IPA near the cured resin to soften it. Then gently remove the cured resin from the glass with a plastic scraper, being careful not to scratch it.

Then clean again with IPA and a soft cloth, and follow with window cleaner to remove any haze.

If you do need a replacement, it is not possible to change just the glass, it is part of the basin assembly, so the entire basin needs to be changed.
