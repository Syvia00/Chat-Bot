Trays Tray dimples - audiology
 Those dimples in the tray can be formed due to the suction-geometry of audiology parts. The geometry can act as a "plumber tool", which then can leave these dimples in the tray.

Our suggestion in this case would be trying the following:

- Set the Light Intensity in the Advanced Parameters to 2mW
- Set the Separation Acceleration to 0.1mm/s
- Run a print with these parameters and see if the dimples reduce or disappear entirely
- If they do disappear, then you can increase the Separation Acceleration to 0.2mm/s

Important, when doing these adjustments, enable the Fast Print Mode and Separation Detect, to compensate for reduced printing speeds.

Please let us know if that works.
