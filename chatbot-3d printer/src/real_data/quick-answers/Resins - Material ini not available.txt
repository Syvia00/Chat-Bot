Resins Material ini not available
 Hello 

https://www.asiga.com/accounts/#tab_material

We dont appear to have one for the specific resin you are asking about, but if you would like, we can provide you with information to make your own material ini file for this resin.

Alternatively, if you would like Asiga to make a material ini file for you, we can do so if you will send 1L of the resin to our technician in Germany. Apart from the cost of the resin and shipping, there would be no cost to you for the work involved.

Please let us know if you would like any more information.

Regards,
