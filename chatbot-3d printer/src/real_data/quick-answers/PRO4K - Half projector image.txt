PRO4K Half projector image
 As sometimes only half of the image is printing, please check the projector image with the focus glass (wear the orange glasses).

Go to Maintenance> Focus while the glass focus plate is on the basin glass, and see if the focus image is displayed in full or in half.
If the focus image shows in half, the first thing is to try toggling the 4K mode to the other value and back (usually from ON to OFF, and back). 

The 4k mode setting is under Settings> 4K Mode. See if toggling it resolves the issue and see if now the whole image is displayed.
If the whole image is displayed it could indicate an issue with the projector locking onto the HDMI signal
If it still only shows half the image, try restarting the printer and showing focus again, to see if you can see the whole focus image.

Please test by restarting the printer and showing the focus image a few times, since it's possible the projector has a glitch and is not properly initializing, or there may be an issue with the HDMI cable in the printer.
