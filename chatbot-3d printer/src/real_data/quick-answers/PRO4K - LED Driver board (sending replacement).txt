PRO4K LED Driver board (sending replacement)
 We will send an LED driver board to exchange in this projector, which will resolve this issue. 

Please find attached the exchange procedure for the board.

There is a checklist included with the replacement board. Please fill out the checklist after the exchange and please include it with the return shipment. 

Let us know once the exchange is done, so we can generate the RMA documents to return the faulty LED driver board to the Asiga factory.

Also, there is a no-return fee of $350USD for the exchange board which is does not need to be paid unless the board is not returned within 30 days. Once we receive the faulty board back, we will remove the no-return fee.

Please let us know need any help, or have any questions.
