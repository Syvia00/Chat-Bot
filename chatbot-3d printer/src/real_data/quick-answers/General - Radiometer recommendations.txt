General Radiometer recommendations
 Here are the 2 external radiometers that Asiga recommends. Please note, Asiga does not sell the radiometers, they need to be purchased directly from the manufacturer:

1. International Lights, the link in the store will redirect you to the manufacturers: https://myaccount.asiga.com/store/P-0064/

https://www.intl-lighttech.com/products/asiga-ilt2445

2. The other brand is the Opsytec Dr.Groebel RM-12, model "UVA+", here is the link for that:
