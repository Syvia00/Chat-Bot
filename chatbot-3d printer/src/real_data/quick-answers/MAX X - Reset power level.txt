MAX X Reset power level
 In the printer ini file above, the values are

Platform Intensity=
Platform Intensity Adjusted=
Power Level=

To fix this, please go to Maintenance> Service> LED> Power level and set it to 100%

Then go to Maintenance> Service> LED> calibrate radiometer, and set it to 17.54, which is what it was before.

Then go to Maintenance> Service> LED> Power level and set the percentage down until the reading is 12.02.

This is what the printer was set to when it left the factory. These settings put the output back to 12.02, which should work well.

Then send us printer ini again please, so we can check the changes.

Please let us know if you need any further help.


The factory value of the LED in your projector should be ~36.2mW, but your printer thinks it has a light intensity of 30mW. This could lead to an incorrect calculation of the exposure times and therefore leading to failed prints.

We can fix that and see if this makes a difference.
First please go to Maintenance> Service> LED> Power Level and increase the power level back to 100%
Then go to Maintenance> Service> LED> Calibrate Radiometer, and enter the value of 36.2mW and save it.
Now go back to Maintenance> Service> LED> Power Level and reduce the power, so you can see a light intensity of around +-30mW and save it. Then upload a new job and see if this makes any difference.

Best regards,
