Encoders Encoders stop zero position completing
 If there are issues performing the platform calibration that stop it proceeding past the detecting step the encoders may not be responding properly.

Is the printer near any vibrating machine, such as a milling machine? if so the vibrations may be upsetting the encoders.

Ensure the printer is in a place free of vibrations. Then, if you go to Maintenance> Position Encoders> Zero Position Encoders, with the platform raised, and the resin tray removed, does the zeroing the encoders return the blue dot to the middle for a while?
If so, the behaviour is normal, you can then press on each corner of the basin in turn, and the blue dot will move to the appropriate corner. Then zero again.

If the encoders are immediately causing the blue dot to jump around after zeroing, then you should remove the basin and inspect the encoders for any issues, eg foreign objects, or a resin spill.

Then perform the encoder calibration, as shown in the max manual, starting at page 56.

Please let us know if there are an issues with this.

Do you have the calibration weight to perform this process?

For us to check the printer generally, can you please give us the printer ini file?

To get that file, please open Composer, click New Build, click your target printer, then click the blue globe icon in the top right corner, a web browser will open, please go to the tab System Information and you will see View Printer.ini. Right click that file and click Save Target As/ Save Link As to download the text file. Please then attach the file onto this ticket.

Also, if you recalibrate the encoders, please send the updated printer ini file for us to check.
