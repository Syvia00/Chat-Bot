Materials:

Build Logging:
  Composer updates all build logs from all printers and can be resource intensive.
  It is advisable to run a separate process to specifically handle build logging.
  Combine --profile=DIR, --ipc-socket=- and --headless to run as a separate process.
  Alternatively, increase --threads=COUNT if you experience hung processes.

Properties:
  Composer will attempt to load Composer.ini in the Composer application path.
  Properties are exported and imported whenever a window dialog is opening.

  Specify --jsonrpc-client=- for interactive scripting in the command line interface.
  Parameters can be positional %1, %2, ... or named %(a), %(b), ...

Returns:
  1: arguments redirected to a running instance
