Composer DME files
 We currently have DME files for 3Shape, Exocad, and Dental-Wings, you can download the files from the Software tab in your Asiga account, here is the direct link: https://myaccount.asiga.com/accounts/#tab_software

If you are looking for DME files for non-Asiga resins, please check with the resin manufacturer if the resin has been validated with the Dental-design software, and if there is a DME file available.


STAFF NOTE:
Resin needs to be validated by 3shape
Ours was, if we have the DME file for it

Vasthu Syahbani: 
-I believe the resin maker would approach 3shape if they wish to validate their material
- 3shape will provide test / sample files to be printed and sent to 3shape
- the process above may occur many times
- ultimately the goal is to fine-tune the 3shape export parameters to yield accurate printing results

(9:17:31 AM) Phillip Wylie: if dme files exist for a resin, to help 3 shape size parts optimally, then the dme files should presumably be with the resin supplier?
(9:17:51 AM) Vasthu Syahbani: I suppose either party can host it
(9:18:07 AM) Vasthu Syahbani: DME files are to be loaded into the 3Shape program

(9:19:46 AM) Vasthu Syahbani: okay so a quick search for example with Straumann

(9:19:59 AM) Vasthu Syahbani: looks like they allow people to download it from their website
