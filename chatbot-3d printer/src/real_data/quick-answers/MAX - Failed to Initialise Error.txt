MAX Failed to Initialise Error
 
This error message comes up if there is an issue with the microSD card causing the printer to be unable to boot.

Can you try removing the Micro SD card from the motherboard, make sure that all the contacts on the card are clean, reinsert it and see if this makes a difference? 

Please see the attached photos for how to access the microSD card.

If the printer still doesn't boot after checking the Micro SD, then it is likely the microSD card is faulty. 

Can you then remove the microSD card from the printer, and recover the printer ini file? 

There is a printer ini file recovery tool attached. 

You will need to put the microSD card in a card reader on a Windows PC, and then run the recovery tool.

When it sees the card, it will ask where to save the printer ini file to on the PC.

Please do not format any partitions, which windows may ask when the microSD card is inserted.

Then attach the printer ini file to the support ticket, we will the printer ini need it to prepare a replacement Micro SD card for the printer.

Regards,
