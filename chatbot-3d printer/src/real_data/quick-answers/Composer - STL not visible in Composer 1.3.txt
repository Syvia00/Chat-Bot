Composer STL not visible in Composer 1.3
 Please ask the customer to try setting Options → Preferences… → OpenGL and turn off vertex buffer object?

Otherwise, can you attach the latest Composer.log file from a temporary folder? 
To get the Composer.log file:

1. With Composer running
2. Open Windows Explorer
3. Enter into the address bar %TEMP%
4. Open the last (most recently) modified Composer.*~ folder
5. Log files will be in the folder.
