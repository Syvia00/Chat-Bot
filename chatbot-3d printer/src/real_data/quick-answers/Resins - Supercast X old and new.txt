Resins Supercast X old and new
 Hello,

There are different material files depending on the expiry date of the resin.

You may need to change to using a different material file to get the best results with the resin you have.

Please check the expiry date of the resin, if the Supercast X resin has Expiry: 2023/07 or earlier, use the material file labelled Supercast X old. If it is from 2023/08 or later, please use the material file Supercast X.

The files are available from here: https://myaccount.asiga.com/accounts/resources/Materials/Asiga/385%20nm/

Recent versions of Composer have the newer material file for Supercast X, which only works with resin made during or after August 2021.

You can find the latest Composer here:

Please let us know if any further help is needed.

Regards,
