General Clean basin
 It is not possible to change the glass, it would be necessary to replace the metal basin the glass is a part of.

Please use IPA (IsoPropyl Alcohol) and a soft cloth to remove any uncured resin from the surface of the glass, wear gloves to ensure the resin does not contact skin.

To remove any cured resin, soften it by using IPA. A cloth soaked in IPA and put on top will prevent the IPA evaporating quickly and leave the IPA in contact with the resin for longer, which will help to soften it. Then use a plastic scraper, and a soft cloth with more IPA to remove the resin from the basin glass. Be careful not to scratch the glass when doing this.

After cleaning with IPA, use window cleaner to remove any streaks.

Please let us know if any further help is needed.
