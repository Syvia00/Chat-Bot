MAX Projector options
 For a replacement projector for the Max we have the following options:

1. A brand new projector, with a 1 year warranty, for $1350usd plus shipping, the old projector doesn't need to be returned. This will be a high power projector.

2. A refurbished projector, with a 6 months warranty. Asiga will charge $550usd plus shipping, which is payable in full. There will be a non return fee of $1500usd which does not need to be paid, unless the faulty projector is not returned within 30 days.

Before swapping the projector, please ensure the firmware is at the latest version.

The latest firmware, as well as instructions to install it, is here:

Let us know once the exchange is done, so we can generate the RMA documents to return the faulty projector to the Asiga factory.
