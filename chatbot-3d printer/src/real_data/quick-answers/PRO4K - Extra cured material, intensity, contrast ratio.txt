PRO4K Extra cured material, intensity, contrast ratio
 
Additional troubleshooting is required to diagnose this issue.

Stage 1.
Ensure the glass on the basin is clean.
To check for dirt or marks on the glass we recommend using a torch and by shining it onto the glass from different angles you will see whether there are marks or smudges present.

Stage 2.
Check LED intensity using an external radiometer.

- Wear the orange UV protective glasses supplied in the printer toolkit
- Go to Control> LED and turn on the projector LED
- Measure light intensity in 5 spots or even 7 spots for a greater sample: in the top left corner, top right corner, center, center left, center right, bottom left, and bottom right corner.  Make notes of these measurements.

Provide this data in the support ticket.

Stage 3.
Verify contrast ratio of projector using an external radiometer.

- Place the external radiometer head in the center of the build area
- Measure the light intensity under Control > LED, and note down the value as seen on the external radiometer
- Check the light intensity under Maintenance> Service> LED> Radiometer and note down the measured value, as seen on the external radiometer
