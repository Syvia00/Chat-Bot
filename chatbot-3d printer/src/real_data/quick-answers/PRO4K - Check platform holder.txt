PRO4K Check platform holder
 Can you please check if when the platform is raised, and the calibration screw and the grub screw are tightened up, that you are unable to move the platform from side to side with your hands? i.e. that it is really strongly tight? (it shouldn't move). Also, if you remove the platform from the platform holder, and loosen the calibration screw and the grub screw, does the central piece of metal under the black knob (between the semicircular pieces) move freely? (it should be able to move freely) This will clarify that there is no issue with the platform holder.

Regards,
