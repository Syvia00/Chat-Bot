MAX Platform holder change
 To replace the platform holder, please see the photos in the attached zip file.

After the exchange is done, we would recommend doing the deflection calibration and then the zero position calibration.

Use the dome nut accessory to perform the deflection calibration.

The MAX user guide shows this on page 63, "Calibrate Deflection":

Please let us know should you have any questions regarding the exchange or the procedure.
