Trays Low force trays
 The Low Force tray consists of 2 thinner films which in total are as thick as the regular tray film.

The appearance is more matte and homogeneous compared to the regular ones. So the parts look more beautiful, which is great for show-off prototypes and they are also slightly smoother, so its good for casting/moulding as well.

The Separation Forces are a lot less, but the films are more fragile. So handle them with greater care.
When possible use Separation Acceleration of 0.1 to make the separation even more gentle.

The films work very well with Fast Print and Separation Detection, as the Separation takes place much earlier than on regular films.

There is no advantage when printing large cross section (on the contrary, the pulling force of larger areas can stretch the thin films easier)

It will print with less stress on printed parts, and is recommended for resins that are viscous in the tray, or flexible when printed.
