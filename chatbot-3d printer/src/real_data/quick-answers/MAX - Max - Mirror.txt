To swap the mirror you would need to remove the side panels (Pictures 1 & 2), front panel (Pictures 3 & 4), and bottom metal panel. (Picture 5)

Then there are six screws holding in place the mirror plate. (Pictures 6 & 7)

After the old mirror is removed (Picture 8), the replacement sticky pads go onto the plate where the old one used to be (Picture 9), then the mirror is put on with the blue protective plastic facing up (Picture 10). The printer can then be reassembled and the basin removed to access and peel the blue plastic off.

Then it would be necessary to check the image size, and alignment of the printer.
