Resins Keysplint soft
 Since the Keysplint Soft material is relatively sticky and viscous, you would need to set up the model in a specific way.

If you havent read the material guide for this resin already, please have a look at following file: https://www.asiga.com/accounts/resources/Materials/KeyStone/Keysplint%20Soft%20-%20Advanced%20Supportstrategy%20Recommendation.pdf

The 2 most important aspects for this resin are:

1. The orientation
2. A good contact width of the supports

To 1: Keysplint used to recommend an orientation of 45 degrees, they now changed their recommendation to an angle of 75-90 degrees, trying to expose as less of the surface of the model as possible

2. The contact width of the supports is very important. Its recommended to use very thick supports for the base of the model. Here its recommended to use a contact width of 2mm (anchor support) and 1.5mm to further support the base.
Then for the rest of the model you can consider 0.8-1mm contact width

Please also ensure you have the latest firmware installed for your machine, as well as the latest Composer version.
Please also check if there was an update for the Keysplint Soft material ini. In addition, there is a customized material ini file online, called  Keyprint KeySplintSoft_V2.0_SW_008-stronger supports.ini. If you have not used that version, I would also recommend to try that material file.


Since the Keysplint material is relatively sticky and viscous, you would need to set up the model in a specific way. I would perhaps also recommend that you contact your reseller, they might have practical print experience with the Keysplint resin and could guide you directly.

Otherwise please check the Supporting-guide for the keysplint resin, this can be found in your Asiga account, here would be the direct link:
https://www.asiga.com/accounts/resources/Materials/KeyStone/Keysplint%20Soft%20-%20Advanced%20Supportstrategy%20Recommendation.pdf

The 2 most important aspects:

1. A good and solid supporting, as you will see in the guide. It will recommend placing a few quite thick supports (anchor supports) at critical base layers. Then for the rest of the model, an array of thinner supports

2. The orientation of the model. You would need to tilt the model, recommended would be an angle of 75-90Â°. 

Please also ensure youre using the latest material.ini file for the keysplint material, (Keyprint KeySplintSoft_V2.0_SW_009-advanced_stability.ini).
