Composer Clear Composer Settings
 Reinstalling Composer will not remove any settings for Composer, to clear the settings:

1. Browse to Program Files/Asiga/Composer

2. Press Shift and right click. Select open Powershell window here

3. Run Composer.exe --profile-reset

After clearing the settings, please uninstall then redownload and reinstall Composer from here:

Then you will have a fresh installation of Composer, which should work.

Please let us know if this helps.
