Misprints & Print Defects Breaking off 2mm supports
 Hello,

Thanks for sending those files. The printer ini file does not show any issues with the printer.

As you have had a print failure, please clean the tray, and perform the platform calibration again before trying to print again.

The part appears to be breaking off the supports.

Is this a solid part? If so, there is no need for supports, you can print the part directly on the baseplate, and it will adhere well to the platform.

If you are printing a hollow dental model, use supports, but also use a baseplate of 1/2 mm. The supports also would be better able to hold on to the model, and work better if you make then 4mm long, with a spacing of 2mm-3mm, and a contact width of at 0.7mm - 0.8mm.
