PRO4K No focus image, No errors
 Can you please unplug the HDMI cable from the projector, and plug it into a 1080p computer monitor, and show the printer focus image? 

Does it show up on the screen?

This will help to determine if the computer board is sending the picture, and if the HDMI cable is functioning.

Also, while the printer is on, please take a photo of the electronic boards, the square power board down the bottom (behind the right-hand side panel), and also the other boards behind the LCD screen door. Please see attached photos for how to access there.
