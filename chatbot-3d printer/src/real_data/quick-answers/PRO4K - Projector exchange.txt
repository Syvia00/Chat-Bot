PRO4K Projector exchange
 Thanks for the photos, including the focus image.

Unfortunately the projector in this printer has developed a fault, and will need to be replaced.

Although the printer is out of warranty, we will cover this as a warranty case, as goodwill.

We will send a replacement projector to you for the repair. We will include a magnetic cover for the bottom of the printer, to prevent the ingress of dust.

Let us know after the exchange is done, and we will send RMA documents for the faulty projector.

Please let us know if any help is needed to change the projector.

In addition, we will leave a no-return fee of $4000 USD for the exchange projector which is not payable and only becomes payable if the faulty projector is not returned within 30 days. Once we receive the faulty projector back, we will remove the no-return fee.

Regards, 



To swap the projector you will need the tools in the PRO 4K Reseller Service Toolkit PN/05226, and a radiometer to check the light intensity. Can you please confirm you have these tools, otherwise it will be necessary to order them to be able to exchange the projector, and set it up properly.
