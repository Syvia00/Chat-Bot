PICO1 Pico 1 slider
 You can check if the slider of the printer is sitting too high. If that's the case, then it can damage the models during printing and, for example, result in a shifting of the layers. A simple test to check that, would be to take the focus plate flip it around, so that the clear sticker is facing up and doesn't make contact with the slider, then place it on the tension ring, so that it's sitting over the slider. Make sure the slider blade is clean, so the glass is not being dragged because it's sticky. There is also a Focus Plate sticker on it, make sure this isn't touching the tension ring either. Then go to Control> Slider, and "home" the sensor back and forth. Can you see that the focus plate is being dragged by the slider? If it does, then the slider might be sitting too high for some reasons, if it doesn't drag, then the slider would be ok.
