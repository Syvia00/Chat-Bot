MAX New projector (outdated)
 Asiga is now offering high power projectors as replacements, this projector type will most likely also not show the pixelation issue anymore. The previous option is not available anymore. The price will change slightly. The bond charge is still $2000usd, but the price for the actual "Projector replacement fee", has changed from $550usd to $1100usd.

Meaning at first the full price of $3100USD becomes payable, once Asiga receives the old projector back within 1 month, Asiga will credit back $2000, so the final price for the projector exchange would be $1100.

This variant will be more reliable than the previously offered refurbished projector, a.) for having a stronger LED and b.) for not having the pixelation issue anymore.

Please let us know if you would like to place an order.
