General General Questions
 To give you some proper advice and be able to solve your problem we will need as much information as possible:

1. Which material (+batch number) are you using?
2. Which INI File are you using (+where did you get it from)?
3. Is Composer at latest version?
4. Is Firmware at latest version?
5. What were the conditions of your last successful print?
6. What changed in between (hardware, software, material)?
7. Please export and attach the Debuglog, Errorlog and Printer.ini
(-go to the web interface of the printer (in composer the little blue "world" icon)
-then go to systeminformation tab
-then right click on Debuglog and save as "debuglog.txt"
-do the same for the Buildlog, Errorlog and printer.ini
(depending on your language setting they might be called different, but are highlighted in light blue and found below the "Printer System time: ...")
8. Please export and attach the print you are trying to print.
