Misprints & Print Defects Extra cured material
 Thanks for the photos.

The parts themselves look cured well, but in many of the photos there is extra cured material, like tags.

This will be due to light scattering during printing. To resolve this, please ask the customer to clean the glass very thoroughly. Use IPA (IsoPropyl Alcohol) and a soft cloth, then follow up with window cleaner to remove any streaks. Check with a torch, or the light from a smart phone that there are no smudges or smears of resin on the basin glass. It needs to be crystal clear. Be careful not to scratch the glass when cleaning.

Also check the mirror underneath, if it has dust on it, please remove it with a camera lens dust blower. This should resolve the issues with the extra cured resin.

In one picture it looks like the baseplate did not attach to the platform properly at the start. Does the customer mix the resin well before starting printing?

Please check the platform calibration is being done with care, and that downward pressure is put on the black knob when tightening the screw.

Also, confirm that the calibration is verified with a piece of paper to ensure there are no gaps under any corners, which confirms that the platform is parallel to the glass.

For hollow dental models we recommend supports be 4mm, the spacing 2mm-3mm, and the contact width 0.7mm-0.8mm. This allows resin to flow well during printing. Please ask the customer to try these settings.

For us to check the printer generally, can you please give us the printer ini file?

To get that file, please open Composer, click New Build, click your target printer, then click the blue globe icon in the top right corner, a web browser will open, please go to the tab System Information and you will see View Printer.ini. Right click that file and click Save Target As/ Save Link As to download the text file. Please then attach the file onto this ticket.

Regards,
