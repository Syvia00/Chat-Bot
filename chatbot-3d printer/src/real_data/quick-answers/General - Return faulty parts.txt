General Return faulty parts
 Hello , 

The cost of the return of faulty parts is to be borne by the dealer, not Asiga.

Only a few faulty components ever need to be returned to Asiga, projectors, build platforms, platform holders, internal power supplies, and basins. Fortunately these cases are only occasional. With any other faulty components its not usually needed to return them.

For the faulty projector, we have set the courier to Own Courier so that you can use whichever service is most convenient.

Regards,
