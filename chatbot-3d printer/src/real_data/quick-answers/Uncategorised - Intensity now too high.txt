Uncategorised Intensity now too high
 Hello,

Asking in general, is the printer in the same room as milling machines or possibly where gypsum models are being processed, so there's potentially lots of microdust in the room?

If that is the case, you may want to consider changing the location of the printer to a less dusty room.

Currently, the internal UV sensor is reading a higher value than the actual calibrated light intensity, this will cause Composer to calculate shorter exposure times, which will lead to printing issues.

We can fix this remotely, to do so please do as follow:

- remove the build tray from the printer and ensure the build platform is clean
- close the hood of the printer, as were going to show LED light
- then go to Maintenance> Service> LED> Calibrate Radiometer and confirm and SAVE the value that you can see there, which should be 13.56
- then to verify if the internal UV sensor successfully took these changes, go to Maintenance> Service> LED> Radiometer and check if the value there reads approximately around the calibrated value of 13.56

And please send us the printer.ini once more, to see if the changes were successful.
