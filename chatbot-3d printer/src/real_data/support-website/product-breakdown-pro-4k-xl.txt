Basin
The basin holds the resin tray and acts as a gateway between the resin and UV light.
This glass plate must be kept crystal clean and free from debris.

Build Tray
Build trays contain the resin during the printing process.
They are constructed of a flexible film within a rigid plastic frame.

Asiga recommends one Build Tray per material.  Do not use the same Build Tray for multiple materials as this may create material cross-contamination and transfer of uncured materials.

Asiga SPS™ technology
Asiga SPS™ technology is managed by 4 position encoders that surround the basin glass.
These sensors detect actual build platform positioning to ensure the layers in your 3D printed part are formed accurately.
