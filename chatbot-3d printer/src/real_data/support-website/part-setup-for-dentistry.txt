Hollow ModelsMake sure hollow models have drain holes at the base of the models to prevent volumetric pressures from occuring.Learn more here >Hollow models can still carry a lot of liquid resin in their cavities after printing. Especially with higher viscous materials. This can lead to increased cleaning efforts and quicker contamination of your cleaning solution.Consider printing solid models over hollow models for process optimisation.Always use the appropriate design settings, which can be found here >

At least 1 bar connecting the two sides of the arch is necessary to prevent warping of the model. This is especially true for Lower Dentures.Always use the appropriate design settings, which can be found here >
DentaTRAYTake the perfect impression with Asiga DentaTRAY. Asiga DentaTRAY is an accurate, rigid and stable 3D printing material to aid the reproduction of a patient’s anatomy.Compatible with all types of impression materials, Asiga DentaTRAY provides a precise and fast solution for complex cases. 

How to manufacture a Custom Impression Tray

Indication listRecommended slice thicknessRecommended part orientation

Custom Impression Trays100-150 µm.Custom Impression Trays should be oriented so that the intaglio surface of the tray is facing away from the build platform. Angulation of the custom tray is not crucial. 

Part Orientation 

Part orientation will determine how many parts you can get on a single build.More importantly it will also be a factor in achieving the highest accuracy.Horizontal orientations will produce higher precision.

DentaIBTAsiga DentaIBT is a biocompatible material for manufacturing Indirect Bonding Trays. Indirect Bonding Trays are used to accurately position orthodontic brackets onto the patient’s teeth. DentaIBT is a clear material that allows UV transmission for curing the brackets in place.The rubber-like characteristic of Asiga DentaIBT provide a firm hold during the bonding process and then flexibility when peeling away, without tearing or discomfort to the patient. 

Indication listRecommended layer thicknessRecommended part orientation

Indirect Bonding Trays100 µmHorizontal: Indirect bonding trays should be oriented so that they are horizontal touching the build platform on a flat plain. 

Part Orientation 

Part orientation will determine how many parts you can get on a single build.More importantly it will also be a factor in achieving the highest accuracy.Horizontal orientations will produce higher precision. 

Design tips 

When designing, it is best to have a flat plain so the part can sit directly on the build platform.Always use the appropriate design settings, which can be found here >
