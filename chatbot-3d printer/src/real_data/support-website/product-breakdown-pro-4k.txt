Build TrayBuild trays contain the resin during the printing process.They are constructed of a flexible film within a rigid plastic frame.Asiga recommends one Build Tray per material.  Do not use the same Build Tray for multiple materials as this may create material cross-contamination and transfer of uncured materials.
