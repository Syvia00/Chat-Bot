What is Multi Range? 

Requirements 

Composer 1.3.2 and firmware 2020-07-14 or later. 

Multi Range allows users to select different layer thicknesses or change advanced parameters throughout a build using print ranges. 

When would this be useful? 

To speed up the range that involves Baseplate and Supports To reduce Light Intensity for the transition from cone/supports to model to extend tray life time and prevent delamination or suction cup damage.To speed up the part of the object that has no top surfaces with  shallow angles. We can optionally add a range that smoothens out top surfaces with shallow angles by reducing layer thickness. 

Sounds great, how do I use it? 

Activating Multi Range is simple in the Advanced Parameters of Composer.Start by opening your buildOpen the build wizard and navigate until you get to this screen 

By default there are 2 ranges:Burn inRange 1 Click Add Range to add a range. 

‘Print Range from’ will display in mm where this range starts‘Print Range to’ will display in mm where this range stops‘Slice thickness’: what slice thickness this range will print In the example shown the first range will print in 25 microns up to 20mm height.Exposure times for each print range will update automatically based on layer thickness chosen.

Burn-In Range0.00 mm to 0.2 mm: 200 micron layer thicknessLight intensity: maximumSeperateion Acceleration: 0.1We can change the Layer Thickness to a thicker one as no critical details or shapes in this layer. We change the Seperation Acceleration to 0.1 to make release of the film much smoother – protecting the film from damage.

Print Range 25mm to 8mm: 100 micron layersLight Intensity: 1mWSeperation Acceleration: 0.1Undersides and sides facing towards the platform are usually printed much smoother and work well with 100 micron. We add this small range to reduce stress on the tray by reducing Light Intensity and Seperation Acceleration (note: 0 will turn Seperation Acceleration off completely, 0.1 is the lowest value accepted).
Print Range 2
5mm to 8mm: 100 micron layersLight Intensity: 1mWSeperation Acceleration: 0.1
