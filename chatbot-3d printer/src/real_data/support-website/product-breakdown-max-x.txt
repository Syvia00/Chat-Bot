Bodywork 

Below is a summary of the main components of the MAX X. 

Hood
The MAX X Hood is constructed of UV blocking hard plastic. This protects the resin from being cured by natural light & the user from UV light emitted.

Build platform
The build platform is the centerpiece of the MAX X.
It is engineered from anodised steel which makes it extremely durable.

Basin
The basin holds the resin tray and acts as a gateway between the resin and UV light. This glass plate must be kept crystal clean and free from debris.

Build tray
Build trays contain the resin during the printing process. They are comprised of a flexible film that moves with the build platform.
Asiga recommends one Build Tray per material.  Do not
use the same Build Tray for multiple materials as this may create material
cross-contamination and transfer of uncured materials.

SPS™ Positioning Encoders
Asiga SPS™ technology is managed by 4 position encoders that surround the basin glass.
These sensors detect actual build platform positioning to ensure the layers in your 3D printed part are formed accurately.
